# Number composition
This mini-game offers you to pass the following, rather simple test at any of the selected difficulty levels: in a certain time you must calculate the difference between the sum and one of the terms.  

The number of correct answers for a successful result, as well as the time for completing the test for each difficulty level are unique.
On the main screen, we are greeted by two options: read the rules of the game and start playing.
